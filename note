1. layer number -- coefficient
2. softmax-sigmoid
3. data structure

polynomial

polyhedral: Ax=B

active learning
boundry remaining

0.	fixed step size: discard crowded points (datapoint dropout) -> why crossing the boundry will reduce accuracy
0.	optimize code

1.	random generate 20 polynomial from simple to complicated
2.	expand 2D to nD (random parameters) -> compare middle point, gradient, original method
3.	decide ND discontinueous shap (polyhedral)

4.	make graph
5.	biased datapoints

1.	reduce data points
2.	test possible combination of gradients in 2D
3.	select testing data in a space uniformly
4. 	sampling for mid points (n-folder, number inverse proportion to n)
5.	adjust parameters for worse result
6.	seperate polyhedral areas (near, far)
7.	automatically generate excel file

1. layer number -- coefficient
2. softmax-sigmoid
3. data structure

polynomial

polyhedral: Ax=B

active learning
boundry remaining

0.	fixed step size: discard crowded points (datapoint dropout) -> why crossing the boundry will reduce accuracy
0.	optimize code

1.	random generate 20 polynomial from simple to complicated
2.	expand 2D to nD (random parameters) -> compare middle point, gradient, original method
3.	decide ND discontinueous shap (polyhedral)

4.	make graph
5.	biased datapoints
